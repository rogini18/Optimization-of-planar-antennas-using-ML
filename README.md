# üì° Optimization of Planar Antennas Using Machine Learning

This project focuses on optimizing the design of **planar MIMO antennas** for 5G mmWave applications using **machine learning algorithms**. Traditional antenna design methods rely heavily on simulation and trial-and-error, which are time-consuming and computationally expensive. In this work, models such as **Random Forest, KNN, and SVM** are trained on simulation data to predict and optimize antenna parameters like **gain**, **bandwidth**, **VSWR**, and **efficiency**.

The goal is to reduce development time and improve design accuracy by leveraging data-driven methods. The final optimized antenna was fabricated and tested, with performance closely matching simulation predictions.
